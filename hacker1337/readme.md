### Action
Recommend starting with the carrier board
#### Carrier Board
1. Solder the LEDs to the board -> ensure that they are placed squarely and that there is NOT excess solder
2. Prepare the 1.0mm sockets
   - Count the number of PINs and pull the PIN directly after (This allows you to cut the socket)
3. Solder the sockets to the board
   - This will be a tight fit as the sockets will be right against the LEDs
4. Solder the resistor onto the back of the board
5. Solder the larger PINs to the board
6. [IMPORTANT STEP] -> ground trace missing
   - Take and solder a short piece of wire between ground PIN in column one and solder it to ground PIN -> this will fix the missing groun trace to the rest of columns

#### Micro Badges
1. Solder the LED to the badge
2. Solder the Resistor
3. Solder the 1.0mm PINs
4. [OPTIONAL] Add hot glue (recommended as improves the glow factor of the LEDs)
5. Place onto the carrier board
   - Hacker -> H - ac - k - er
   - 1337 -> 1 - 3 - 3 - 7
