# Build Guide
## Arctic Wolf's large (Main) minibadge

1. Seperate the board into 2 sections -> discard the mouse bite section, it is not needed.
2. Start by soldering the components onto the back of both the upper and lower sections of the badge.
3. Solder the components onto the face of the badges.
4. Solder the header PINs into the lower board
5. Now solder the upper board onto the header PINs -> there should be a small gap between the 2 boards
6. Solder the components onto the Wolf's head
7. Solder the Wolf head over the open triangle, using the solder pads -> there should be little to no gap between these two boards
