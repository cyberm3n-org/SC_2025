## Arctic Wolf's large (Main) minibadge for Main/Large 

### Build List Items
| Reference | Value | Footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1,D2 | Orange | 0805 |
| D3,D4 | Blue | 0805 |
| D5 -> D9 | White | 0805 |
| R1,R3,R4 | 30Ω | 0805 |
| R2 | 62Ω | 0805 |

###  Actions
1. Seperate the board into 2 sections -> discard the mouse bite section, they are not needed.
2. Start by soldering the components onto the back of both the upper and lower sections of the badge.
3. Solder the components onto the face of the badges.
4. Solder the header PINs into the lower board
5. Now solder the upper board onto the header PINs -> there should be a small gap between the 2 boards
6. Prepare the 1.0mm sockets for the Micro Badges
  - You will need to count 2 PINs and pull the third PIN from the socket; this will give you a location to cut the socket -> repeat until you have enough sockets
7. Place and solder the sockets onto the board -> be sure to not bridge the PINs
8. Solder the components onto the Wolf's head (See Wolf Head below)
9. Solder the Wolf head over the open triangle, using the solder pads -> there should be little to no gap between the top of the Wolf's head and the top  board

## Wolf Head
### Build List Items
| Reference | Value | Footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1,D2 | White | 0805 |
| R1 | 30Ω  | 0805 |

 ### Actions
 1. Decidde if Wolf head LEDs should be a flashing motion or a solid light and bridge the jumper accordingly
 2. Solder the LEDs onto the board
 3. Soldet the Resistor
 4. Attach head to top of the AW Main badge.
 
## Micro Extender Badge

This badge is fairly straight forward; the only action is to solder the 1.0mm socket headers and 2.54 mm PINs.
1. Prepare the 1.0mm sockets for the Micro Badges
  - You will need to count 2 PINs and pull the third PIN from the socket; this will give you a location to cut the socket -> repeat until you have enough sockets
  - For the center sockets you can optionally count 4 PINs and pull the 5th PIN out
2. Soldet the 2.5mm PINs to the board

## Micro Badges
### Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team, & Black Badge
There are slight diviations but the gist is the same for each of these badges.

### Build List Items
| Reference | Value | Footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | White | 0402 |
| R1 | 10Ω  | 0402 |

1. Solder LEDs (there is a small amount of green on the back side and a tiny dot/hole to indicate polarity)
2. Soldet the Resistor
3. [OPTIONAL] Add hot glue covering the LED and the negative space
4. Plug in to correctly sized header
5. Enjoy
