## Arctic Wolf's large (Main) minibadge for Main/Large 

### Build List Items
| Reference | Value | Footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1, D2 | Orange |0805 |
| D3, D4 | Blue | 0805 |
| D5 -> D9 | Whiteß≈ | 0805 |
| R1, R3, R4 | 30ΩΩ | 0805 |
| R4 | 62Ω | 0805 |

###  Actions
1. Seperate the board into 2 sections -> discard the mouse bite section, they are not needed.
2. Start by soldering the components onto the back of both the upper and lower sections of the badge.
3. Solder the components onto the face of the badges.
4. Solder the header PINs into the lower board
5. Now solder the upper board onto the header PINs -> there should be a small gap between the 2 boards
6. Solder the components onto the Wolf's head
7. Solder the Wolf head over the open triangle, using the solder pads -> there should be little to no gap between these two boards

## Wolf Head
### Build List Items
| Reference | Value | Footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 -> D2 | White | 0805 |
| R1, | 330  | 0805 |

 ### Actions
 1. Decidde if Wolf head LEDs should be a flashing motion or a solid light.
 2. Attach head to top of the AW Main badge.
 
## Micro Extender Badge

This badge is fairly straight forward; the only action is to solder the 1.0mm socket headers and 2.54 mm PINs.

## Micro Badges
### Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team, & Black Badge
There are slight diviations but the gist is the same for each of these badges.

1. Do resistor
